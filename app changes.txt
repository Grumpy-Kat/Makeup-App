Appearance:
-// Make RecommendedSwatchBar smaller (is way more than 10% of the screen, is it using the correct screenSize?)
-// Make "Find Colors" button text size smaller on Main1Screen

Bugs:
-// Fix sorting
-// Fix Main0Screen sometimes not refreshing after adding new palette
-// Fix PaletteDivider not saving with physical camera or gallery
