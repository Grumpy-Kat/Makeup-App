Usability:
-// Make ColorPicker's value slider a little taller to make it easier to move

Features:
- Add instructions to PaletteDivider to take photos in bright lighting, preferably by an open window
- Add instructions (such as touch directions) and splash screen on the first opening
- Add settings and help page
- Add photo lightness and brightness controls to settings
- Sort Main2Screen by similar finish?

Bugs:
-// Increase Main2Screen color distance
- PaletteDivider does not allow for diagonal dragging, only horizontal or vertical
- Phone recieves error if photo or camera access is not allowed (this disables other features, so catch error and give user message)
- RecommendedSwatchBar sometimes closes while the second swatch's is opening
- Investigate occasional black-screen bug when first downloading or updating app and then taking picture of palette
