Usability:
- Explain Main2Screen
-// Make "More..." button on InfoBox bigger
-// Make menu navigation buttons darker
- Explain palette divider vs custom
- Explain columns vs rows?
- Add directions for PaletteDivider (must input columns and rows, order of steps, explicit instructions to drag outer corners first)
- Make dragging inner corners easier
-// Make text fields more explicit in double text popups

Features:
-// Don't show tags when not editing and not selected on SwatchScreen
- Fix color names (burgundy, cream, peach, rust, taupe, mauve, brown, light brown, dark brown, beige, lighe beige, dark beige)
- Add instructions (such as touch directions) and splash screen on the first opening
- Add settings and help page
- Take center of swatch images in PaletteDivider
- Lighten swatch images of PaletteDivider

Bugs:
-// RecommendedSwatchBar closes even when clicked on it 
-// Make Main1Screen not do navigation dragging (color wheel can be dragged)
-// Saved looks don't open sometimes (probably not overriding clicks)
- Main2Screen switches to Today's Look Screen when pressing "Use Photo" too quickly
-// When text field is empty, the string becomes null, instead of disallowing enter
