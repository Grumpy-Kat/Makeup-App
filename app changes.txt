Appearance:

-// Make dark theme way darker
-// Make menu bar icons closer to background color (look at Reddit)

-// Have dropdowns use theme colors
-// Have popups use theme colors
-// Make "Find Colors" button text size smaller on Main1Screen
-// Move "Add Image" button down on PaletteDivider
-// Make plus button on Main0Screen have a white icon

-// Fix app crashing when pressing back when editing is enabled on LookScreen
-// Fix being unable to delete first added swatch
-// Fix sorting
-// Reverse vertical dragging of inner borders on PaletteDivider
-// When editing a swatch and then leaving the swatch screen without leaving edit mode, the edits do not save (at least not when going to AddPaletteScreen after; initially shows visual change when returning to Main0Screen, but does not seem to actually save)
- Fix Main0Screen sometimes not refreshing after adding new palette
