Usability:
-// Make dragging corners easier
-// Make text fields more explicit in double text popups

Features:
- Add instructions (such as touch directions) and splash screen on the first opening
- Add settings and help page
-// Add and fix color names
-// Specify similar and opposite color categories
-// Add weight to recommended colors (distance has the greatest, similar has the middle, opposite has the least)
-// Take center of swatch images in PaletteDivider
-// Lighten swatch images of PaletteDivider

Bugs:
- Main2Screen switches to Today's Look Screen when pressing "Use Photo" too quickly
-// PaletteDivider goes to weird black screen sometimes when adding a photo (maybe after pressing "Retake", pressing "Use Photo" too quickly, or double clicking "Use Photo")
-// RecommendedSwatchBar closes even when clicked on it
-// Saved looks don't open sometimes (probably not overriding clicks)
